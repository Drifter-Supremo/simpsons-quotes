## Active Context

### Current Work Focus
- Creating initial memory bank files based on the project brief.

### Recent Changes
- Created `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.

### Next Steps
- Create the remaining core memory bank file: `activeContext.md`.
- Once all core files are created, the memory bank will be initialized.
- Wait for user instruction on how to proceed with the project roadmap.

### Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensuring the initial content of memory bank files accurately reflects the project brief.
- Not starting on the main project tasks until instructed by the user.
