### What's Left to Build
- Complete the button click logic for quote change.
- Ensure mobile responsiveness.
- (Optional) Add season filter dropdown.

### Current Status
- Vite + React project initialized and dependencies installed.
- Project structure merged, all existing files preserved.
- src/data/iconicQuotes.json updated with curated quotes and meets all requirements for 1.4.
- Tailwind CSS fully set up and configured.
- Base UI structure implemented and styled.
- QuoteCard component is now styled as per the theme. 
- Flip animation is implemented.
- Deployment Platform Update: The project is now deployed using GitHub Pages (serving from the `/docs` folder on the `master` branch), instead of Vercel or Netlify. The Vite config uses the correct `base` path and the workflow is documented for future reference.

### Known Issues/Notes
- None yet.
- Important: All styling and animation are handled by Framer Motion and inline styles. No CSS classes are used for the flip animation or component styling.
